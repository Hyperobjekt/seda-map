## What should I know before I get started?

### Packages In Use

The main libraries and frameworks used in this project include:

  - React
  - Redux (for application state)
  - Material UI (for base components)
  - MapboxGL (for map rendering)
  - E-Charts (for scatterplots)
  - Algolia (for search)

Some pieces of functionality have been separated into their own separate module so they can be reused on the container site.  These modules are:

  - `react-seda-scatterplot`: provides base functionality for rendering charts with SEDA data
  - `react-seda-search`: allows searching locations in SEDA data

Relevant, but not included in this project is the [Educational Opportunity Website](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/seda-site).  Any issues relevant to the website that are not in the explorer should be filed there.

### Application Structure

#### Constants (`src/constants`)

The constants folder contains the configuration values and language used within the explorer.

Common tasks relevant to this folder include:
  - updating some text used in the explorer (`en.js`)
  - updating the links in the fly open menu (`site.js`)
  - updating options related to the seda data, such as scatterplot ranges (`dataOptions.js`)

#### Components (`/src/components`)

This structure of the `/src/components` folder is based on [atomic design principles](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) as described below:


  - **Atoms** (`src/components/atoms`): smallest base components (e.g. icons, markers)
  - **Molecules** (`/src/components/molecules`): small components build from one or more atom components (e.g. Panel, Card, etc.)
  - **Organisms** (`/src/components/organisms`): organisms tie together molecules and atoms to provide more complex but isolated functionality (e.g. Header, SiteMenu, Scatterplot, etc.)
  - **Templates** (`/src/components/templated`): templates determine how the organisms, molecules and atoms are arranged on a page. (e.g. Section)

All of the components in the atomic design structure (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates) are [presentational components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0). Presentational components are  components that render based on the props provided and do not depend on connecting to the data store or loading / mutating data.

  - **Connected Components**(`/src/components/seda`): Unlike all the presentational components listed above, these components are connected to the state data store provided by Redux. (e.g. `SedaHeader`) 
  
Connected components are responsible for getting data from the application state and providing it to the presentational components to render the current view.

> **tangent:** structuring components this way has been working okay for me (lane), but i'm not convinced it is the best way. the goal has been to keep the presentational components separate so that they could be utilized in future project if need be.  open to changes or discussion on slack if anyone has suggestions.

#### Modules (`/src/modules`)

This folder contains reducers and selectors for getting and mutating data in the application state, or router.

Common tasks relative to this folder would include:
  - making modifications to routing behaviour (`router.js`)
  - adding custom getters for configuration based on the `dataOptions` constant. (`config.js`)
  - adding / modifying reducers that mutate application state based on actions (all reducers referenced in `index.js`)

#### Actions (`/src/actions`)

This folder contains all actions that are dispatched to the reducers to handle application state mutation.

#### Other Folders

  - `/src/hooks`: contains any custom hooks that are used in the project
  - `/src/css`: styles for components in the project
  - `/src/style`: contains the material UI theme for setting overrides to the material UI components.
  - `/src/utils`: contains general purpose utility functions and data fetching from map tiles
  - `/src/views`: contains default `App` component and page component for the explorer.

### Application State

The application state is managed by Redux.  The store is configured in `/src/store.js` contains middleware for:

  - Sending events to analytics when certain actions happen.
  - Saving user selections to local storage so they are restored when the user returns.

The application state is structured as follows:







## How Can I Contribute?

Pre-requisites:
  - must pass linting, tests, or any other checks performed in Travis CI.


## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
* Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export default class ClassName {

  }

  // Instead of:
  class ClassName {

  }
  export default ClassName
  ```
* Place requires in the following order:
    * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
    * Built in Atom and Electron Modules (such as `atom`, `remote`)
    * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Place class properties in the following order:
    * Class methods and properties (methods starting with `static`)
    * Instance methods and properties
* [Avoid platform-dependent code](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/cross-platform-compatibility/)

### CoffeeScript Styleguide

* Set parameter defaults without spaces around the equal sign
    * `clear = (count=1) ->` instead of `clear = (count = 1) ->`
* Use spaces around operators
    * `count + 1` instead of `count+1`
* Use spaces after commas (unless separated by newlines)
* Use parentheses if it improves code clarity.
* Prefer alphabetic keywords to symbolic keywords:
    * `a is b` instead of `a == b`
* Avoid spaces inside the curly-braces of hash literals:
    * `{a: 1, b: 2}` instead of `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`
* Include a single line of whitespace between methods.
* Capitalize initialisms and acronyms in names, except for the first word, which
  should be lower-case:
  * `getURI` instead of `getUri`
  * `uriToOpen` instead of `URIToOpen`
* Use `slice()` to copy an array
* Add an explicit `return` when your function ends with a `for`/`while` loop and
  you don't want it to return a collected array.
* Use `this` instead of a standalone `@`
  * `return this` instead of `return @`
* Place requires in the following order:
    * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
    * Built in Atom and Electron Modules (such as `atom`, `remote`)
    * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Place class properties in the following order:
    * Class methods and properties (methods starting with a `@`)
    * Instance methods and properties
* [Avoid platform-dependent code](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/cross-platform-compatibility/)

### Specs Styleguide

- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) specs in the `./spec` folder.
- Treat `describe` as a noun or situation.
- Treat `it` as a statement about state or how an operation changes state.

#### Example

```coffee
describe 'a dog', ->
 it 'barks', ->
 # spec here
 describe 'when the dog is happy', ->
  it 'wags its tail', ->
  # spec here
```

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use [AtomDoc](https://github.com/atom/atomdoc).
* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:
    * Reference classes with `{ClassName}`
    * Reference instance methods with `{ClassName::methodName}`
    * Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`

#### Example

```coffee
# Public: Disable the package with the given name.
#
# * `name`    The {String} name of the package to disable.
# * `options` (optional) The {Object} with disable options (default: {}):
#   * `trackTime`     A {Boolean}, `true` to track the amount of time taken.
#   * `ignoreErrors`  A {Boolean}, `true` to catch and ignore errors thrown.
# * `callback` The {Function} to call after the package has been disabled.
#
# Returns `undefined`.
disablePackage: (name, options, callback) ->
```

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Most labels are used across all Atom repositories, but some are specific to `atom/atom`.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in [open issues across `atom/atom` and all Atom-owned packages which are labeled as bugs, but still need to be reliably reproduced](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+label%3Abug+label%3Aneeds-reproduction) or perhaps [open pull requests in `atom/atom` which haven't been reviewed yet](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+repo%3Aatom%2Fatom+comments%3A0). To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in `atom/atom` only and also across all Atom repositories. We  encourage you to read about [other search filters](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) which will help you write more focused queries.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on `atom/atom` if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.
