They encompass the total set of educational opportunities available in a community.',
  'HP_*_*_GRD_*_*': 'Schools’ contributions to educational opportunity are reflected in the growth of children’s test scores while they are in school. The growth of test scores indicates how much students learn while in school. Because average test scores are influenced by many out-of-school opportunities, they reflect more than what children learn while they are in school. So growth of test scores is a better measure of school quality.',

For example, rates of change tell us whether this year’s third graders are doing better than last year’s third graders.

  'HELP_AVG_CONCEPT_A': `Average student test scores are influenced by children’s opportunities to learn in their homes, in their neighborhoods, in the childcare, preschool, and after-school programs they attend, from their peers and friends, and in their schools. Because of all these influences, average test scores are not a good way to assess how much children learn in schools. But they are a good way to assess the average set of educational opportunities available to children in a community. Where average scores are low, students have fewer opportunities to learn. Schools are better evaluated using learning rates, which measure how much student scores improve while they are in school.`,
  'HELP_GRD_CONCEPT_A': `Learning rates measure how much student scores improve each year while they are in school. This is better way to assess what children learn in schools than average test scores, which are heavily influenced by factors outside of school. To understand the distinction, think of a hospital: We wouldn’t assess a hospital based on the health of its patients; rather, we’d judge it on how much its patients’ health improves as a result of their time in the hospital. Similarly, we shouldn’t evaluate a school based on the average scores of its students, but rather by how much their test scores improve while in school.`,
  'HELP_COH_CONCEPT_A': `Average student test scores are influenced by children’s home environments, early childhood experiences, community resources, and schools. The trend (or change) in average student test scores from one year to the next indicates whether educational opportunities are improving or declining in a community. Where the trend is positive, students’ opportunities to learn are improving. Opportunities may improve over time because of changes in school quality or because of changes in children’s family resources, home environments, early childhood experiences, and community resources.`,
  'HELP_SES_CONCEPT_A': ``,
  'HELP_AVG_A': `The average test score is based on the average of standardized math and English Language Arts (ELA) tests taken by public school students in grades 3 through 8 between 2009 and 2016. See the <a href="#">FAQ</a> for more detail.`,
  'HELP_GRD_A': `The learning rate is based on changes in average test scores from each year and grade to the next year and grade (e.g., changes from 2015 3rd grade scores to 2016 4th grade scores). The learning rates are calculated using standardized math and English Language Arts (ELA) tests taken by public school students in grades 3 through 8 between 2009 and 2016. See the <a href='#'>FAQ</a> for more detail.`,
  'HELP_COH_A': `The trend in test scores is based on changes in average test scores from each year to the next in the same grade (e.g., changes from 2015 3rd grade scores to 2016 3rd grade scores). The test score trends are calculated using standardized math and English Language Arts (ELA) tests taken by public school students in grades 3 through 8 between 2009 and 2016. See the <a href='#'>FAQ</a> for more detail.`,
  'HELP_SES_A': `Socioeconomic status (SES) is a broad measure of the economic and social resources available in a community. It is based on information about the income, educational attainment, employment, and structure of all the families living in the community served by a school district or county. This information is combined into a single composite rating for each community. A rating of 0 represents the national average of socioeconomic status; higher ratings represent more affluent communities. See the <a href="#">FAQ</a> for more detail. `,
  'HELP_SEG_A': `Segregation measures the extent to which students in the region attend schools with different poverty rates. To compute it, we first compute the average free lunch rate in black, Hispanic, poor students’ schools and the average free lunch rate in white, nonpoor students’ schools. The segregation measure is the difference between these two average rates. A value of 0 means that black, Hispanic, or poor and white, or nonpoor students attend schools with equal free lunch rates, on average. Positive numbers indicate that black, Hispanic, or poor students in the region attend higher-poverty schools than white or nonpoor students. See the <a href="#">FAQ</a> for more detail.`,
  'HELP_FRL_A': `The free lunch rate measures the proportion of students in the school who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches through the National School Lunch Program. Students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches if their family income is below 185% of the poverty threshold. A school with a free lunch rate of 0% has no poor or near-poor students; the higher the free lunch rate, the greater the number of poor students. See the <a href="#">FAQ</a> for more detail.`,

  'HELP_HOW_Q1_A':  `The Educational Opportunity Explorer offers 3 different ways of looking at Educational Opportunity in the U.S.: a map, a chart, and a “split screen” view of both. Use the <strong>Map | Chart | Map + Chart</strong> buttons in the tool to select one of these views.`,
  'HELP_HOW_Q2_A':  `<p>At the top of this Explorer, you can select from <strong>3 Key Measures</strong> of educational opportunity to display in the map and chart:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Average Test Scores, which reflect educational opportunities in and out of school</li>
      <li>Learning rates, which reflect school effectiveness</li>
      <li>Trends In Test Scores, which reflect changes in educational opportunity</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Just below these buttons, you can use the <strong>“Showing data for…”</strong> drop-down menus to filter by demographic (e.g. “all students” or “female students”) or the gap between demographics (e.g. “male-female gap”), and the type of places (counties, school districts, or schools) you’d like to display. In the Chart view, you can also choose to view data for the entire country, or individual U.S. states.</p>
